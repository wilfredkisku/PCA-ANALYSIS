# PCA Analysis (Dimensionality Reduction)
The goal of this assignment is to carry out dimension reduction using the concept of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The sub goals include operations to be carried out dimensionality reduction on particular data such as visual data or images. Also, to carry out feature reduction on a randomly generated dataset to
show a visual mapping of data from 3D to 2D plane or similarly can be extended from a 2D plane to a 1D or any other higher dimesional planes into lower dimensions space.
